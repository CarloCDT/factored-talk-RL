    mkvirtualenv factored_talk_rl
    
Activate your brand new virtual environment if needed:

    workon factored_talk_rl
    
Change the directory to the factored-talk-rl repo:

    cd factored-talk-rl

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You should be ready to play and challenge Max Verstappen agent in a race now!

### Playing against the AI

To play against the AI simply run

    python play_car_racing.py

You will be asked to give an integer number which will the random seed to choose the track. Both you and the AI agent will drive in the same track, and the score will be printed in the terminal window.
